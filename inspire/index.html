<p>Hey, it’s Alondra Young!  I am the Building Healthy Communities Youth Engagement Coordinator from Sacramento!  I had the privilege of working with the awesome people at the Center for Regional Change last summer, using their Putting Youth on the Map (PYOM) website.  In late June, I and other youth leaders from Sacramento hopped on the local city bus and rode up to the UC Davis Campus from Sacramento.  We were able to receive an introduction to PYOM, meet CRC faculty, staff and graduate students, and receive a pretty cool campus tour!  During our training, we learned about the importance of data, navigated the PYOM site, read maps, and learned about the Youth Well-Being Index and the Youth Vulnerability Index. 
</p>
<p>Our big take-away from this training was being able work with other youth leaders by using these tools.  This introduction led us to host a four-session training for other youth leaders in the Sacramento area about how to use data in our advocacy work.  We are now all working together and are using our data mapping skills on the Grades Up Campaign!  This youth-led campaign is intended to provide youth with free academic and community resources that allow students to succeed in school.  It also provides a platform for youth to build confidence and have an active voice in their education.  PYOM has been a very useful tool in enabling us to get access to data, and providing a platform for youth to work together and have a voice!
</p>
<p><em>Hi I’m Alondra Young, and I work for People Reaching Out, where I am the Sacramento Building Healthy Communities (BHC) Youth Engagement Coordinator.  I am the adult ally who helps guide the Sacramento BHC Youth Leadership Team.  This team is made up of 10 amazing youth leaders who are eager to create change in their community.  For fun I LOVE to run.  Just recently, I ran on a 12-woman relay team in a 205-mile race called Ragnar. We ran from San Francisco to Napa Valley!</em></p>

<h2>Out of the Lab and into the World</h2>
<h3>by Geetika Joshi<br>
November 26, 2014  </h3>

<p class="caption" style="width:270px;"><em>November, 2014. Geetika Joshi joins CRC Director Jonathan London in preparing a sumptuous Indian dinner for colleagues, friends and family, celebrating the achievements of the CRC-UCD Collaboration Center partnership in 2014. </em> </p>
</div>

<p>I joined the CRC in the summer of 2013 and stayed on a post-doctoral researcher during 2014.  As a graduate student working on environmental microbiology, this was an opportunity for me to get a taste of regional environmental issues.  My project at the CRC aimed to develop effective relationships between multiple partners, such as biologists, medical science experts, engineers, regulatory agency personnel, environmental justice advocates and social scientists.  The goal was to create a process that would allow community partners to help shape priorities for environmental and health science research.  I worked closely with Jonathan London and Tara Zagofsky, and had the opportunity to learn from them about community engagement, facilitation and conflict resolution.  This was a great addition to my skills as a research scientist.  These skills were instrumental (along with my scientific background, of course) in helping me successfully interview for my current position at the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</p>
<p>The CRC helped me take my rigorous scientific training out of the lab and into the world, beyond publications and academic conferences.  I was, in a sense, like any product of environmental science research.  Ideas are often born in a lab, tested out in the field, and eventually applied on a larger scale, in communities, where they improve people’s lives, lead to new inventions or products, or shape policy.  I followed a similar path.  I started at UC Davis by training in Soils and Biogeochemistry with Professor Kate M. Scow, then moved on to the CRC, and am now working for the State of California.  
</p>

<p>My experience at the CRC has also been emotionally rewarding. It helped me utilize my scientific skills and my love of science and science communication to focus on public engagement.   I also gained a regional perspective and context in my areas of professional interest.  This helped strengthen a "love for the land" In my heart and mind.  I discovered a community outside the portals of academia.  This has helped California feel more and more like a second home to me.   As an immigrant far away from the home I grew up in, I find this has been a great personal gain.  I feel fortunate to have worked with the entire CRC team, and am especially honored to have worked with Jonathan and Tara, who inspire great love and respect from all of their colleagues.
</p>
<p><em>Dr. Geetika Joshi was born and raised in New Delhi, India, where she studied microbiology before joining the Soils and Biogeochemistry Ph.D. program at UC Davis.  Her doctoral research with Professor Kate M. Scow focused on the role of microbes in the degradation of groundwater pollutants.  At Davis, she fell in love with soils, while also exploring her interest in international development with the U.C. Davis chapter of Engineers Without Borders.  It was her quest to connect the public with the sometimes esoteric world of scientific research that led her to work with the  CRC.  </em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Joshi also works with local museums to pursue her interest in science communication. In her leisure time, she loves to cook, especially desserts, and catch up on non-academic reading.  She currently works as an Environmental Scientist for the California Department of Food and Agriculture.  </em></p>

<h2>CRC Tools in the Classroom: See the Connections</h2>

<p>I teach an undergraduate course through Chicana/o Studies called Political
Economy of the Chicana/o Community every spring quarter.  I have three
mid-term papers that are opportunities for students to use
publicly-accessible data (via websites, mostly) to do some analysis of the
education, health, and labor conditions that intersect to shape the
political economies of California's Chicana/o-Latina/o communities. 
</p>
<p>Every year, there is some frustration -- and lots of learning -- about the
(in)ability to find data in these three areas of interest that can be tied
to the same geographical area.  What typically occurs is that students have
to make compromises, moving from presenting a school district or school-
level analysis of their selected community, then having to present a city or
county level analysis of the health and labor conditions.  This means they
lose a lot of that local connection when they work toward synthesizing what
they've learned.
</p>
<p>Last year, one of my students was able to bring a Center for Regional Change
colleague to help the class use the pilot version of the Putting Youth on the Map 
(PYOM) tools, and it was a fantastic resource!  The students who tried it were excited to see the connections among the data tables and maps.  They also came away with a much deeper appreciation for why having full information and multiple data sources can empower communities to hold folks in power positions accountable for the challenges and barriers that keep people -- particularly youth -- from thriving. 
</p>
<p>It was an excellent supplement to the other data sources that the students were using.  The layered design that allows for disaggregation of the PYOM data was useful to my students.  I look forward to learning more about it, and if available this spring, I will certainly make it known to my students.</p>

<h2>Working for the CRC: The Ultimate Millennial Experience!</h2>
<h3>By Meghan Jordan, CRC Web Designer  <br>October 16, 2014</h3>
<img src="images/pyomWide.gif"  width="100%" alt="putting youth on the map screen shot" >
<p class="caption">Screen shot of the Putting Youth on the Map site which can be found <a href="http://mappingregionalchange.ucdavis.edu/youth">here.</a> </p>
<p>This summer, I had an incredible opportunity to work for the UC Davis Center for Regional Change (CRC) as their web designer.  While most of my friends were waitressing, getting coffee for their boss, or filing paperwork all day, I was entrusted to design an entire website on my own. From brainstorming to coding to seeing the site go live – I got to be there through it all!</p>
<p>The site I designed was for the CRC’s project called, <a href="http://mappingregionalchange.ucdavis.edu/youth">Putting Youth on the Map (PYOM). </a>I began work on this site as a project for my spring quarter undergraduate design class with Professor Glenda Drew of the Department of Design here at UC Davis.  In this course we were given the option to try out a project for the CRC, Sesame (an energy group), or create our own project. I chose to work on a project for the CRC because I was excited by their work, and wanted to see it more easily accessible to the public so others could be excited, too. I designed a potential portal page for the PYOM.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of my design course, members of the CRC were able to review and critique my work, as well as that of my fellow classmates. Shortly thereafter, I was connected with Jonathan London, Nancy Erbstein, and Sergio Cuellar from the CRC. They were impressed by my work, asking me to continue the project and make the site a reality. Over the summer, I returned home to the Pacific Northwest and continued creating the website. So I had the ultimate millennial experience: I was able to work from home, 600 miles away from my job site at UC Davis!</p>
<p>The new PYOM site was launched August 26. Now I am at work helping design the CRC’s general website, including this blog. I’m excited to continue my work this school with the Center for Regional Change.  This job has been unique and rewarding. I have been given a lot of responsibility to design and create a website on my own. The people I have had the opportunity to work with at the CRC have lots of innovative ideas, and I have the task of sharing these ideas via the website. This job has been a great opportunity to gain some valuable work experience that will pay off as my graduation date looms near!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for lots of exciting new projects!</p>

<h2>The CRC: Mapping Food Deserts in Placer County </h2>
<h3>by Tricia Caspers Ross, Placer Community Foundation <br>October 13, 2014</h3>
<img src="images/foodbankWide.gif" alt="Placer Food Bank Truck" width="100%">
<p class="caption">Placer Food Bank celebrates the acquisition of its new Mobile Food Pantry with PCF Board Chair, Pam Constantino, and PCF CEO, Veronica Blake. </p>
<p>In fall of 2012, several members of the Placer Collaborative Network met regularly at the Placer Community Foundation (PCF) to brainstorm as to how best to support local food pantries. As a result of these discussions, a task force surveyed 65 local feeding organizations and compiled a report. A few important facts from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in 8 Placer County residents does not know where he or she will find his/her next meal</li>
<li>Applications for CalFresh/Food stamps have increased 200 percent in Placer County since 2008</li>
<li>Most food pantries lack the refrigeration needed to provide recipients with fresh produce</li>
<li>A food desert map was needed to pinpoint areas where pantries are located and where residents lack services</li>
<li>A refrigerated truck could be used as a mobile food pantry to deliver fresh produce to local food pantries</li>
</ul>
<p>Placer Community Foundation supported the Placer Food Bank to work with the Center for Regional Change to create a food desert map. Using the information that the CRC’s map provided, the food bank was able to map out a delivery schedule for its mobile food truck.</p>
<p>A mobile food truck was purchased in May, 2014, with a $43,000 grant from the Placer Community Foundation’s Community Needs Fund. The truck is refrigerated and visits a different community each day, expanding the reach of the Food Bank significantly and removing the need for refrigerators at each food pantry.</p>
